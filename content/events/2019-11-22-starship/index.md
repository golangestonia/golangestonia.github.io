We celebrated 10 years of Go with the first Golang Estonia meetup at Starship.

## Go at Starship by Joel Mislav Kunst

Joel Mislav Kunst shared how Go is used at Starship for their autonomous package delivery robots. Shared his experience that Go is great for performance critical components and that it's easy to learn, but not the best for fast prototyping.

## 10 Years of Go by  Egon Elbre

Egon Elbre explained why he got fascinated with Go already in 2009 and what is the philosophy of Go.
