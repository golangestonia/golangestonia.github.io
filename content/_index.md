We host [events](/events) to bring people together and help them grow. We announce and keep track of our events on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Golang-Estonia/). When we manage to record the meetup them we upload it to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHeIcjPXRniB1IlvgIpL0nw).

For more ad-hoc communication we have a #estonia channel in [Gopher Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/). There is also a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/golang-estonia-meetup.) group that you can follow.
